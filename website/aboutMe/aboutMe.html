      <h2 id = "headerIntro"> Hi, my name is <span id = myName> Whitney Sprung. <span> </h2>
        <hr id = "hr1">
        <p id = p1>I am a senior at Greenwich Academy in Conneticut. I live with my two brothers, mom, dad, and dogs.<hr id = "hr1"> </p>

        <p id = p2> I was born in 2004 and have lived in Greenwich my entire life. I look forward to starting college and
          the countless new experiences I will have in the next four years and beyond. I love to travel and meet new people, so nothing
          is more exciting to me than the prospects of doing so in an academic context. I hope to study abroad to grow my language skills and cultural awareness. <br><br>

          I also enjoy a lot of familiar things. I love to immerse myself in natures and conversations. I find peace in music. My favorite food is sushi, however,
          I am not the best when it comes to rolling maki. I am better at cooking other foods, with my current favorite food to make being pulled pork. Academic topics
          that captivate me include computer science, creative writing, 19th and 20th century European literature, calculus, and more.<br><br>

          I have played piano for over a decade, and currently my favorite song to play
        is <strong>"Waltz in A Minor"</strong> by Frederic Chopin. I love to hang out with friends and enjoy time with
        family. My favorite places on earth are Casco, Maine and Providence, Rhode Island where my mom and grandparents grew
        up. I created this website as an archive of myself and as a way to learn more about me. I hope you enjoy!</p>

      <p id = doggyP>These are my dogs Rusty and Ruggles! Rusty is a cockapoo, Ruggles is a
        "cockapoo"...which means he is more of a mutt. Rusty got his name due to his color, and my dad
        named him. Ruggles is named after the street my mom grew up on, and I named him. They are both around 10 years
        old and I love them very much. However, Ruggles can be quite the menace.
