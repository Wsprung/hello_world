        <p id = p1>I am a senior in high school in Connecticut. I live with my two brothers, mom, dad, and dogs.<hr id = "hr1"> </p>

        <p id = p2> I enjoy a lot of things. I find beauty in nature, serenity in conversation, and focus in music.
        Sushi is my favorite food, but I have yet to master the art of rolling maki. I am better at cooking other foods,
        with my favorite being pulled pork. I have played piano for over a decade, and currently my favorite song to play
        is <strong>"Waltz in A Minor"</strong> by Frederic Chopin. I love to hang out with friends and enjoy time with
        family. My favorite places on earth are Casco, Maine and Providence, Rhode Island where my mom and grandparents grew
        up. I created this website as an archive of myself and as a way to learn more about me. I hope you enjoy!</p>

    <p id = doggyP>These are my dogs Rusty and Ruggles! Rusty is a cockapoo, Ruggles is a
      "cockapoo"...which means he is more of a mutt. Rusty got his name due to his color, and my dad
      named him. Ruggles is named after the street my mom grew up on, and I named him. They are both around 10 years
      old and I love them very much. However, Ruggles can be quite the menace.
