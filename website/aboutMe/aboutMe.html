        <p id = p1>I am a senior at Greenwich Academy in Conneticut. I live with my two brothers, mom, dad, and dogs.<hr id = "hr1"> </p>

        <p id = p2> I was born in 2004 and have lived in Greenwich my entire life. I look forward to starting college and
          the countless new experiences I will have in the next four years and beyond. I love to travel and meet new people, so nothing
          is more exciting to me than the prospect of doing so in an academic context. I hope to study abroad to grow my language skills and cultural awareness. <br><br>

          I also enjoy a lot of familiar things. I love to immerse myself in natures and conversations. I find peace in music. My favorite food is sushi, however,
          I am not the best when it comes to rolling maki. I am better at cooking other foods, with my current favorite food to make being pulled pork. Academic topics
          that captivate me include computer science, creative writing, economics, 19th and 20th century European literature, calculus, and more.<br><br>

          I have played piano for over a decade, and currently my favorite song to play
        is <strong>"Waltz in A Minor"</strong> by Frederic Chopin. I love to hang out with friends and enjoy time with
        family. My favorite places on earth are Casco, Maine and Providence, Rhode Island where my mom and grandparents grew
        up. I created this website as an archive of myself and as a way to learn more about me. I hope you enjoy!</p>

      <p id = doggyP>These are my dogs Rusty and Ruggles! Rusty is a cockapoo, Ruggles is a
        "cockapoo"...which means he is more of a mutt. Rusty got his name due to his color, and my dad
        named him. Ruggles is named after the street my mom grew up on, and I named him. They are both around 10 years
        old and I love them very much. However, Ruggles can be quite the menace.

    <p id = "zhuExcerpt"><span id = "reportCard">Report card comment excerpt from my 12th grade computer
science teacher:</span>  “Your love for learning and programming
is obvious, and you embody the hacker
mindset (in the best way!). You tackle every
problem I present to the class with absolute relish,
from challenge homework problems to the command line practical
that you handled with aplomb. Reading
the comments and extensive notes throughout  your code tells me
that you really want to understand how programs work. You are
ambitious and creative in your programming projects...Keep
up the exceptional work.”

        Click to see a video of me playing <strong>"Valse Sentimentale"</strong> by Franz Schubert. <br>I love this song, and played
        it in a recital prior to COVID-19. What I love about classical <br>piano is that I feel it throughout my body. To me,
        this song is very bittersweet. <br>Through the dimuendos and crescendos I experience the love story of my grandparents, with the final<br>
        notes reminding me of my grandmother's last days. Nothing makes me feel like classical<br> piano does. To play with your emotions
        is to play like the greats; when I began feeling<br> my emotions in every key, my skills heightened. I hope you enjoy
        this song.
